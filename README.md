# Covid-Visualizer

## Disclaimer

This project is made for fun and learning purposes and no profit has or will be made. The design for this visualization isn't original and I basically only wanted to see if I could remake an existing application in d3.js. 

## Description 

This application visualizes the latest Covid-19 data in the world using a choropleth map on a 3D-globe. Some additional visualization methods are used as well for complementary purposes. 


## Inspiration

The idea for this comes from https://www.covidvisualizer.com/ which made a very cool visualization for the current Covid-19 data. I saw this and wanted to see if I could recreate it using [d3.js] (https://d3js.org/).
But all credit to the original for coming up with the idea(s).

## Tools

This visualization of Covid-19 data is made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQery, and of course the library d3.js, which is a great tool for creating modern visualizations for the web. 

## Credit

Once again thanks to https://www.covidvisualizer.com/ for the design idea and to https://covid19api.com/ for providing the data.
